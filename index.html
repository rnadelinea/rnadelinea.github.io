					My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22 ☕ because though there were certain topics where I struggled a bit, I still found the subject very rewarding. I was able to appreciate computer Science and programming significantly more because of this course. The learning materials provided in this course were also very entertaining. Both my professor and instructor were very likeable and approachable, as well. One thing I enjoyed most about this subject is the process of creating and designing graphical user interfaces. It was very fulfilling once I was able to complete my mini project in this course.

				<p class = "paragraph">
					My favorite GE so far is ARTS 1 🎨 because I was able to frequently express my creativity in this class. It also helped that my professor had very engaging lectures and was very considerate of the students. I have always been fascinated with analyzing different art mediums and I was able to feed that fascination through ARTS 1. We also had plenty of freedom in terms of the specifications of the outputs we submitted in this course which made me appreciate our professor's efforts—and as an extension, the subject—to cater to all of us students and to live up to arts being nonconforming.

				<p class = "subject"> ⎯⎯programming language⎯⎯ </p><p class = "subject-ans"> PYTHON </p>
				<p class = "paragraph">
					My favorite programming language so far is Python 🐍 I think I am a bit biased since it was the first *real* programming language I learned, so I gravitate towards it more than other languages. I studied Python during my freshman year, so there was less pressure and more room for mistakes and improvements back then. It was really fun and relatively easy to learn, especially as a first programming language for total beginners.

				<p class = "subject"> ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯food⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ </p><p class = "subject-ans"> PIZZA </p>
				<p class = "paragraph">
					My favorite food is Pizza 🍕 Brick oven pizzas, in particular, are my favorite type. I also like pineapples on my pizza and it's one of my life goals to try as much pizza places as I can. If I could eat only one thing for the rest of my days, it would definitely be pizza. (っˆڡˆς)
